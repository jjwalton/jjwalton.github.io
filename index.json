I will survey the history of discoveries of nonperiodic sets of few tiles following this. In the 1970s, Penrose discovered his remarkable aperiodic set of just two tiles [3], naturally leading to the Monotile Problem(s) of finding a single nonperiodic tile. There are, in fact, many possible variants one may ask: should the tile be 'perfect' in the sense of local isomorphism, do we allow non-geometric matching rules, which isometries of the tile are allowed? etc. With examples such as the Schmitt--Conway--Danzer tile --- a convex polyhedron in 3-space that tiles without translation symmetries but allows screw symmetries --- one even has to be careful in what is meant by 'nonperiodic'. I will explain the subtleties involved here. The first answer to one variant came in the early 2010s, with the (LI-perfect) Taylor--Socolar monotile [6], represented either as a simple hexagon but with next-nearest neighbour matching rules, or purely geometrically as a tile that is not a topological ball. The hexagonal grid and, in particular, the arrowed half hex tiling, has been used several times as the scaffolding for interesting small nonperiodic tile sets [1,7], such as the Penrose $1+\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2$ tilings. This year, the hat monotile was discovered [4], receiving an unprecedented and welcome amount of public attention. Although it is some sense commensurate with the hexagonal lattice, its global structure is completely different from the above previous hexagonal examples. The hat settles the Monotile Problem for a purely geometric tile that is a is a topological ball and only tiles nonperiodically (but is not translationally LI-perfect), and shortly after the spectre [5], which settles the same problem but without requiring reflections of the tile. Within just a few months of discovery, lots is already known about the global dynamical and topological properties of these tilings [2], uncovered by an already advanced toolkit developed within the field of Aperiodic Order.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] M.

These include Penrose’s $ 1+ \\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 $ tiles, the Taylor–Socolar tile and a tile based on ‘orientational matching rules’. These three fall short of solving the problem of finding a single tile that forces aperiodicity purely via tile geometry. In particular, the latter set is more faithfully considered (from the perspective of shifts of finite type) as a twin pair of tiles with charged edges, the two tiles being identical only up to a charge flip that 2-to-1 factors to aperiodic model sets. I will show the proof of aperiodicity of this tile set, which is notably very simple. The three sets above all factor to the aperiodic arrowed half-hex tilings, whilst the hat, although being related to hexagons, forces aperiodicity in a very different way. So, in discussing these other near misses to the strongest forms of the aperiodic monotile problem, I hope to frame what a remarkable discovery the hat was.","tags":[],"title":"Hexagonal Aperiodic Tilings","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682467200,"objectID":"f2e07b4bc97f666eea220cc319bb9f04","permalink":"/talk/2023_loughborough/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2023_loughborough/","section":"talk","summary":"Aperiodic tilings have been big news recently, with the discovery of the hat monotile (or “einstein”).

Two of the most fundamental measures of order for aperiodic patterns are *complexity* (the growth rate in the number of patches of a given size) and *repetitivity* (how regularly patches repeat within the pattern). For *polytopal* cut and project sets – those with Euclidean physical and internal space and polytopal window – these properties may be analysed via an interesting blend of discrete geometry and Diophantine approximation. I will present recent work, joint with Henna Koivusalo, that characterises linear repetitivity (LR) for a natural class of polytopal cut and project sets, extending previous results joint with Henna Koivusalo and Alan Haynes.

The tile is hexagonal with edge markings, which impose simple rules as to how adjacent tiles are allowed to meet across edges. The first of these rules is a standard matching rule, that certain decorations match across edges. The second condition is a new type of matching rule, which allows tiles to meet only when certain decorations in a particular orientation are given the opposite charge. This forces the tiles to form a hierarchy of triangles, following a central idea of the Socolar–Taylor tilings. However, the new edge-to-edge orientational matching rule forces this structure in a very different way, which allows for a surprisingly simple proof of aperiodicity. We show that the hull of all tilings satisfying our rules is uniquely ergodic and that almost all tilings in the hull belong to a minimal core of tilings generated by substitution.

We extend the first result by proving that primitive substitutions on compact alphabets admit a unique (up to scalar multiplication) continuous natural tile length function. The proof involves consideration of an operator associated to the substitution, which corresponds to the transpose of the standard population matrix from the finite setting. By consideration of the dual operator, we find a class of uniquely ergodic infinite tiling substitution systems, although the question of whether unique ergodicity holds in general for compact alphabets remains open.

The analogue of a shift of finite type for tilings is a set of tiles with rules on their relative placements in a valid tiling. One of the most enticing questions in this area is the Monotile Problem: is there a single shape of tile in the plane whose rigid motions may tile the plane, but only non-periodically? Taylor and Socolar gave a satisfying answer to this question with a certain marked hexagonal tile, although to enforce aperiodicity restrictions are needed for neighbours as well as next nearest neighbours of tiles, or alternatively a tile with disconnected interior must be used. I will give an introductory overview of the field of Aperiodic Order through examples, explaining the main constructions of interesting non-periodic patterns. I will then explain recent work with Mike Whittaker on a single aperiodic tile in the plane with edge-to-edge matching rules. Unfortunately these rules cannot be enforced by shape alone, since only symbols in certain orientations enforce matching restrictions.

Regularity properties of such sets are well understood, thanks mostly to well known results by Morse and Hedlund, and physicists have used this understanding to study one dimensional random Schrödinger operators and lattice gas models. A key fact which plays an important role in these problems is the existence of a subadditive ergodic theorem, which is guaranteed when the corresponding point set is linearly repetitive. In this paper we extend the one-dimensional model to cut and project sets, which generalize Sturmian sequences in higher dimensions, and which are frequently used in mathematical and physical literature as models for higher dimensional quasicrystals. By using a combination of algebraic, geometric, and dynamical techniques, together with input from higher dimensional Diophantine approximation, we give a complete characterization of all linearly repetitive cut and project sets with cubical windows. We also prove that these are precisely the collection of such sets which satisfy subadditive ergodic theorems.

This means that they can be described from just a fundamental domain and their symmetry group. An aperiodically ordered pattern is one which can frequently repeat itself on finite patches but without being globally periodic. These are far more complicated to analyse and a variety of abstract tools has been developed to understand them. In this talk I shall explain how one studies them topologically, via associated moduli spaces of locally indistinguishable patterns. Topological invariants are applied, such as K-theory or Cech cohomology. I shall briefly outline how one goes about computing these invariants and how one may visualise what they say about the original pattern. At present most attention is dedicated to studying these patterns translationally. Bringing in rotations introduces some interesting challenges; a 3-dimensional periodic pattern, for example, has associated translational moduli space simply the 3-torus, but the rotational version is a 6-manifold whose topology depends crucially on the rotational symmetries of the pattern.
