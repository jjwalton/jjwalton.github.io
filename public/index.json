For such cut and project sets, we show that **LR** is equivalent to two properties. One is a low complexity condition, which may be determined from the cut and project data by calculating the ranks of the intersections of the projection of the lattice to the internal space with the subspaces parallel to the supporting hyperplanes of the window. The second condition is that the projection of the lattice to the internal space is Diophantine (or ‘badly approximable’), which loosely speaking means that the lattice points in the total space stay far from the physical space, relative to their norm. We review then extend these results to non-convex and disconnected polytopal windows, as well as windows with polytopal partitions producing cut and project sets of labelled points. Moreover, we obtain a complete characterisation of **LR** in the fully general case, where weak homogeneity is not assumed. Here, the Diophantine property must be replaced with an inhomogeneous analogue. We show that cut and project schemes with internal space isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n \\oplus G \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^r$, for $G$ finite Abelian, can, up to MLD equivalence, be reduced to ones with internal space $\\mathbb{R}^n$, so our results also cover cut and project sets of this form, such as the (generalised) Penrose tilings.","tags":["52C23","52C45","11J20"],"title":"A characterisation of linear repetitivity for cut and project sets with general polytopal windows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Walton","Michael Whittaker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1712361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712361600,"objectID":"0bdba7509f115bde2c71bdf78baedc00","permalink":"https://jjwalton.github.io/publication/2021-wwb/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T21:50:45.634663Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-wwb/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that Kellendonk's tiling semigroup of an FLC substitution tiling is self-similar, in the sense of Bartholdi, Grigorchuk and Nekrashevych.

I will survey the history of discoveries of nonperiodic sets of few tiles following this. In the 1970s, Penrose discovered his remarkable aperiodic set of just two tiles [3], naturally leading to the Monotile Problem(s) of finding a single nonperiodic tile. There are, in fact, many possible variants one may ask: should the tile be 'perfect' in the sense of local isomorphism, do we allow non-geometric matching rules, which isometries of the tile are allowed? etc. With examples such as the Schmitt--Conway--Danzer tile --- a convex polyhedron in 3-space that tiles without translation symmetries but allows screw symmetries --- one even has to be careful in what is meant by 'nonperiodic'. I will explain the subtleties involved here. The first answer to one variant came in the early 2010s, with the (LI-perfect) Taylor--Socolar monotile [6], represented either as a simple hexagon but with next-nearest neighbour matching rules, or purely geometrically as a tile that is not a topological ball. The hexagonal grid and, in particular, the arrowed half hex tiling, has been used several times as the scaffolding for interesting small nonperiodic tile sets [1,7], such as the Penrose $1+\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2$ tilings. This year, the hat monotile was discovered [4], receiving an unprecedented and welcome amount of public attention. Although it is some sense commensurate with the hexagonal lattice, its global structure is completely different from the above previous hexagonal examples. The hat settles the Monotile Problem for a purely geometric tile that is a is a topological ball and only tiles nonperiodically (but is not translationally LI-perfect), and shortly after the spectre [5], which settles the same problem but without requiring reflections of the tile. Within just a few months of discovery, lots is already known about the global dynamical and topological properties of these tilings [2], uncovered by an already advanced toolkit developed within the field of Aperiodic Order.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] M.

These three fall short of solving the problem of finding a single tile that forces aperiodicity purely via tile geometry. In particular, the latter set is more faithfully considered (from the perspective of shifts of finite type) as a twin pair of tiles with charged edges, the two tiles being identical only up to a charge flip that 2-to-1 factors to aperiodic model sets. I will show the proof of aperiodicity of this tile set, which is notably very simple. The three sets above all factor to the aperiodic arrowed half-hex tilings, whilst the hat, although being related to hexagons, forces aperiodicity in a very different way.

For *polytopal* cut and project sets – those with Euclidean physical and internal space and polytopal window – these properties may be analysed via an interesting blend of discrete geometry and Diophantine approximation. I will present recent work, joint with Henna Koivusalo, that characterises linear repetitivity (LR) for a natural class of polytopal cut and project sets, extending previous results joint with Henna Koivusalo and Alan Haynes. We show that LR is equivalent to properties C and D for this class. Here, C is a low complexity condition, which itself has a simple characterisation in terms of ranks of intersections of the projected lattice with the supporting subspaces of the window. The property D is a Diophantine condition, analogous to a number being badly approximable by rationals.","tags":[],"title":"Characterising linear repetitivity for polytopal cut and project sets","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655251200,"objectID":"928b89277a4fe7c5174400b474ca7efe","permalink":"https://jjwalton.github.io/talk/2022_exeter/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2022_exeter/","section":"talk","summary":"In extending the study of symbolic substitutions from finite to infinite alphabets, one encounters several obstacles to generalising most of the standard theory.

To study this rotational structure topologically, we consider instead a more complicated space, the rotational hull of the pattern, denoted ${\\Omega\\_{r}}$. This talk shall provide an introduction to the study of these spaces and discuss recent joint work with John Hunton which provides tools for studying the topologies of rotational hulls, for example in calculating their cohomology. In this work a space ${\\Omega\\_{G}}$ was introduced, initially as an intermediate for studying ${\\Omega\\_{r}}$. We show that it is perhaps more natural from a homotopical viewpoint by showing that for periodic patterns the fundemental group of ${\\Omega\\_{G}}$ recovers the classical space group of Euclidean symmetries of the pattern. We thus introduce a new invariant, the pro- or space-fundamental group of ${\\Omega\\_{G}}$, which extends the classical space group to aperiodic patterns. For certain cut and project patterns an alternative definition for the aperiodic space group was given by crystallographers. We compare the two notions by showing that our topological space group naturally projects to the aperiodic space group. The map is always non-injective and so our invariant appears to contain further information.","tags":[],"title":"A homotopical approach to symmetries of aperiodic patterns","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544227200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544227200,"objectID":"7bb3a5a1dd43bb21f2d1c91055cc52c9","permalink":"https://jjwalton.github.io/talk/2018_bielefeld/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018_bielefeld/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"On the topology of rotational tiling spaces","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539820800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539820800,"objectID":"62749bc0a77416c7ad44d179e55ce256","permalink":"https://jjwalton.github.io/talk/2018_glasgow/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018_glasgow/","section":"talk","summary":"Through examples I will introduce the field of aperiodic order.

In one dimension, prototypical mathematical models for quasicrystals are provided by Sturmian sequences and by point sets generated by substitution rules. Regularity properties of such sets are well understood, thanks mostly to well known results by Morse and Hedlund, and physicists have used this understanding to study one dimensional random Schrödinger operators and lattice gas models. A key fact which plays an important role in these problems is the existence of a subadditive ergodic theorem, which is guaranteed when the corresponding point set is linearly repetitive. In this paper we extend the one-dimensional model to cut and project sets, which generalize Sturmian sequences in higher dimensions, and which are frequently used in mathematical and physical literature as models for higher dimensional quasicrystals. By using a combination of algebraic, geometric, and dynamical techniques, together with input from higher dimensional Diophantine approximation, we give a complete characterization of all linearly repetitive cut and project sets with cubical windows. We also prove that these are precisely the collection of such sets which satisfy subadditive ergodic theorems.

In another direction, supposing that ${Y}$ has uniform patch frequencies, one may consider the set of frequencies of patches of size ${r}$. We consider an important class of Delone sets, the so called cut-and-project sets. Such a setup is determined by a system of linear forms, along with a choice of “window”. In this talk we will discuss how, for certain windows, Diophantine properties of the linear forms forces the number of frequencies of patches of size ${r}$ to stay low, and in some cases even bounded, as ${r \\to \\infty}$.

This page will explain more about the amazing discovery of this special tile. At the bottom, you can find some print-outs to try building large patches of tiles at home.\nWhat is the hat tile, and who found it? Here is the hat tile:\nIt looks simple enough, it is a polygon (a shape made of straight sides), with 13 edges. Simple shapes with interesting properties aren\u0026rsquo;t discovered that often, so you might think that it was likely found hundreds, maybe thousands of years ago! But, in fact, it was discovered very recently, around 2022 by David Smith:\nThe above photo of David is from this excellent Quanta article on the discovery. David Smith has been variously described as an \u0026lsquo;amateur mathematician\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;hobbyist\u0026rsquo;. This is no bad thing! Although not employed as a mathematician, he is clearly a gifted geometer, and his love of it led him to his discovery. It just goes to show, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a professional mathematician to discover an important new shape!\nIt is called the \u0026lsquo;hat\u0026rsquo; because it looks a bit like a top-hat. I personally think it looks a bit more like a t-shirt, if you turn it around (several others have told me the same)!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s special about the hat? It is true (but hard to show!) that, if you have an unlimited supply of hat tiles, you can use them to cover the whole infinite plane. Think of it as covering the floor, but with the floor going on forever in all directions!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not too special, we already know of plenty of shapes of tiles that tile the plane. For example, the standard tessellation of squares, which you might find in your bathroom, can also tile the whole plane:\nThe above tiling is periodic. This means that you can slide the whole thing over and line it up exactly with the original (and you can do this in two different directions). Another way of thinking about it, is that there\u0026rsquo;s a block which repeats over and over, in the same way, across the whole plane. Once you know the basic building block, and how it repeats, you know how it looks everywhere.\nCan you think of any other tilings like this, based on other shapes? Hint: ask the bees!\nIt is also not too hard to find shapes, like a 2-by-1 rectangle, which allow for tilings which are not periodic (and are perhaps quite random):\nbut also permit periodically repeating tilings:\nPeriodic patterns, since they repeat, are relatively simple for us to understand. Indeed, mathematicians have found all of the possible ones, in some sense (there are 17 possibilities, given by the\t\u0026ldquo;wallpaper groups\u0026rdquo;).\nThe hat tile is different. Even though you can tile the whole plane with hats, going on forever, the only tilings you can make never periodically repeat! This makes them more complicated\u0026hellip; and more interesting!\nDiscovery of the hat Before the hat, we already knew that there can be collections of tiles which can tile the plane only non-periodically. The first set was found by Robert Berger. But, instead of being just one tile, it consisted of 20,426 \u0026ldquo;domino-like\u0026rdquo; tiles! How on Earth could he have done this? Well, his discovery was based on some interesting mathematics, linking tiling problems to questions in logic, related to how computers work.\nThe race was on to find much smaller sets of non-periodic tiles!\nAfter some progress on this, around the 1970s, the physicist Roger Penrose brought the number down to just 2. He found a pair (actually, two pairs, but they make similar tilings) of tiles, called the kite and dart tiles, pictured below (image from Wikipedia):\nThere is a rule that the different coloured markings need to continue over edges (or one can alternatively turn these into bumps and dents to force the same rule). Here is part of an infinite tiling they make (with different colours of tiles):\nThe above image is from the University of Bielefeld\u0026rsquo;s Tilings Encyclopedia. I recommend looking through this website for other images of beautiful aperiodic tilings!\nThus, following Penrose\u0026rsquo;s discovery of a pair of non-periodic tiles, there was a natural question: is there a single shape of tile, which can tile the whole plane but only non-periodically? We knew we could do it with two. What about just one?\nFifty or so years on, David Smith was experimenting with shapes called \u0026lsquo;polykites\u0026rsquo;. These are formed by putting together particular shapes, called kites, which you get by cutting a regular hexagon by lines through the centres of its edges, as in the image below:\nOne (of six) of these kites has been shaded.\nChallenge: Try printing the above twice and cutting out the kites. See if you can arrange eight of them together to build the hat tile at the top of this page!\nAt some point, David found a shape (the hat!) that he seemed to be able to keep tiling further and further with. This sometimes happened for other shapes: you might find a \u0026lsquo;block\u0026rsquo; which can then be repeated forever, making periodic tilings. But this one was different. It seemed to keep tiling, but never in a periodic way.\nHow do we actually prove the shape tiles forever, and only non-periodically? That needs some Maths! You can look at the mathematical research paper proving that here, although even for professional mathematicians this is not easy to follow! (but there are some nice pictures in it you might be interested to see). David needed some help with this, and first recruited Craig Kaplan, a Canadian mathematician and computer scientist, who had experience in coding these kinds of tessellation problems.\nCraig set a deadline of Christmas that year to try to find the proofs, but was unable to. So they brought on another world-renowed expert to help, Chaim Goodman-Strauss, an American mathematician specialising in geometry. The group quickly also recruited Joseph Samuel Myers, from the UK, to help. Although not a working mathematician, Joseph got a degree in Mathematics from Cambridge, helps with Maths Olympiad activities and also had a lot of experience in these geometry problems.\nSeveral months later, in March 2023, they announced their result and put their research paper online for everyone to read. The paper introduced the hat, and explained a proof of why it can tile forever, but only non-periodically, neither being easy to show!\nAs you\u0026rsquo;ll find out when trying to make tilings with the hat you sometimes need to flip the tile over. Perhaps you think this is cheating. If so, fear not! The same team who found the hat later found another tile, called the spectre tile, which can also tile the whole plane, only non-periodically, and you only need to use the tile one way up! Here is a picture of a tiling of the spectre (ignore the different shades and light lines near the edges, all tiles are the same and can still be made as polygons we can cut out!), this image from MoMath:\nA new area of Mathematics Mathematicians and physicists are interested in these \u0026ldquo;aperiodically ordered\u0026rdquo; structures as a new area of research! In Maths, lots of structures we\u0026rsquo;ve seen before turn out to be linked to these patterns. In Physics, tilings can be interesting models of how structures repeat in real materials.\nTake diamond, for instance. As you probably know, this is an extremly stong material. Part of the reason is its atoms are arranged and linked in a periodically repeating way, using the following fundamental \u0026lsquo;building block\u0026rsquo;:\nAnimation from Wikipedia. Much like how two-dimensional shapes can be used to cover the plane, tiny versions of the above can be put together in three-dimensional space, and this is the structure of diamond. Generally, beautiful crystals have this kind of structure (but with other symmetries).\nScientists can try to work out the structures and symmetries of these objects by shining X-rays at them and looking at the patterns this makes on a screen. In the 1980s, crystallographer Dan Shechtman found the following image from this kind of experiment:\nNotice that there is a beautiful pattern of spots. Therefore, the material he was testing must be highly organised! On the other hand, it turns out to have \u0026lsquo;forbidden symmetries\u0026rsquo; so could not be based on a periodically repeating pattern! Therefore, he had shown that ordered but non-periodic patterns, like 3d versions of the hat (or, then, Penrose) tiles, can be made. The scientific community was initially very sceptical (and in some cases, rudely critical) of his work. However, we now know more, that these really are a new kind of aperiodically ordered material, and he was vindicated by winning the Nobel Prize (one of the most important in science), in Chemistry, in 2011.\nWe are still exploring what applications these materials might have. Perhaps interesting and useful materials can be made from these so-called \u0026lsquo;quasi-crystals\u0026rsquo;. And mathematicians study such structures in a new area of research, called Aperiodic Order.\nTiling forever and a challenge for at home You can think of the hat as like a jigsaw piece, just for one of the world\u0026rsquo;s hardest jigsaws (and one that goes on forever, with only one shape of piece!). However, the tilings it can make, whilst never periodically repeating, still have a lot of interesting structure. They\u0026rsquo;re not totally random!\nChallenge, Step 1: Try print a few sheets of the following hat tiles, and carefully cut them out. If you click on the image, you can get a pdf file if that\u0026rsquo;s easier for you:\nStep 2: Print the (two-sided) pdf at this link.\nEach side has a template for a \u0026lsquo;cluster\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;patch\u0026rsquo; of tiles, one with 7 tiles and one with 8.\nStep 3: Try covering the template regions precisely with hat tiles. When you do, tape them together for later! Make quite a lot of the 8-tile clusters (around 16 or so, to start with) and just a couple of the 7-tile clusters, those are much rarer.\nStep 4: Now try to put these clusters together!\nIn Step 3, you found that the tiles groups into these clusters. In Step 4, you might see that these clusters can form bigger \u0026lsquo;super-clusters\u0026rsquo;. These super-clusters can be built, and together group into super-super-clusters too, and so on, this keeps going forever, with similar building instructions between each level! All possible hat tilings have this kind of \u0026lsquo;hierarchy\u0026rsquo;.\nA hint of how this might work can be seen in Figure 2.11 (page 19) of the newest version of the discovers\u0026rsquo; paper here. Trying to make this precise is hard, but it is one way of showing the tile can tile forever and only non-periodically.\nLots of other interesting non-periodic tile sets, like the Penrose tiles earlier, also have this hierarchical structure! And there will certainly be many interesting, new versions we discover in the future too, a whole world of fascinating patterns is there to be explored.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3b26ff98bd52ec22431ef24d8673f78d","permalink":"https://jjwalton.github.io/hat/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hat/","section":"","summary":"Story of the Hat Tile If you\u0026rsquo;re here, chances are that you recently tried building patches of so-called hat tiles in a University of Nottingham event.
