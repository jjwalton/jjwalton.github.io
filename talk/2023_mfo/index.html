<p>The first nonperiodic tile set was discovered by Berger in 1966, in his resolution of Wang&rsquo;s Domino Problem. I will survey the history of discoveries of nonperiodic sets of few tiles following this. In the 1970s, Penrose discovered his remarkable aperiodic set of just two tiles [3], naturally leading to the Monotile Problem(s) of finding a single nonperiodic tile. There are, in fact, many possible variants one may ask: should the tile be &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; in the sense of local isomorphism, do we allow non-geometric matching rules, which isometries of the tile are allowed? etc. With examples such as the Schmitt&ndash;Conway&ndash;Danzer tile &mdash; a convex polyhedron in 3-space that tiles without translation symmetries but allows screw symmetries &mdash; one even has to be careful in what is meant by &rsquo;nonperiodic&rsquo;.

The first answer to one variant came in the early 2010s, with the (LI-perfect) Taylor&ndash;Socolar monotile [6], represented either as a simple hexagon but with next-nearest neighbour matching rules, or purely geometrically as a tile that is not a topological ball. The hexagonal grid and, in particular, the arrowed half hex tiling, has been used several times as the scaffolding for interesting small nonperiodic tile sets [1,7], such as the Penrose $1+\epsilon+\epsilon^2$ tilings.
