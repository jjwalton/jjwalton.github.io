abstract: "The cut and project method is a central construction in the theory of Aperiodic Order for generating quasicrystals with pure point diffraction. Linear repetitivity (**LR**) is a form of ideal regularity of aperiodic patterns. Recently, Koivusalo and the present author characterised **LR** for cut and project sets with convex polytopal windows whose supporting hyperplanes are commensurate with the lattice, the weak homogeneity property. For such cut and project sets, we show that **LR** is equivalent to two properties. One is a low complexity condition, which may be determined from the cut and project data by calculating the ranks of the intersections of the projection of the lattice to the internal space with the subspaces parallel to the supporting hyperplanes of the window. The second condition is that the projection of the lattice to the internal space is Diophantine (or ‘badly approximable’), which loosely speaking means that the lattice points in the total space stay far from the physical space, relative to their norm. We review then extend these results to non-convex and disconnected polytopal windows, as well as windows with polytopal partitions producing cut and project sets of labelled points. Moreover, we obtain a complete characterisation of **LR** in the fully general case, where weak homogeneity is not assumed. Here, the Diophantine property must be replaced with an inhomogeneous analogue. We show that cut and project schemes with internal space isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n \\oplus G \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^r$, for $G$ finite Abelian, can, up to MLD equivalence, be reduced to ones with internal space $\\mathbb{R}^n$, so our results also cover cut and project sets of this form, such as the (generalised) Penrose tilings."
